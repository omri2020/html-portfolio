<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Omri, I am living in Israel and I'm 24. As a citizen in Israel, after finishing Highschool at 18
  I had to serve the army for 2.8 years. In the army I was a sapper at the combat engineering unit, which has given me a lot of
  values and a strong character. After finishing my serve at 21, I've decided to find a profession that I am intersted
  at and that I would be able to help people with, that's how I've decided to start learning web designing.
